\chapter{Image Reconstruction}
- recap results of last chapter
- restate motivation of imaging
- chapter overview

\section{Implementation}
- pytorch advantages:
- parallel processing for tensors
- API for c++
- CUDA-capabilities
- pre-calculating BP weights
- how to use measured gains
- increased performance with ifft

\section{Results}
- side-lobes
- compare to array gain
- computational intensity ?
- azimuth-range and 3D images
