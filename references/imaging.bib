  abstract = {Processing the signals received on an array of sensors for the location of the emitter is of great enough interest to have been treated under many special case assumptions. The general problem considers sensors with arbitrary locations and arbitrary directional characteristics (gain/phase/polarization) in a noise/interference environment of arbitrary covariance matrix. This report is concerned first with the multiple emitter aspect of this problem and second with the generality of solution. A description is given of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of 1) number of incident wavefronts present; 2) directions of arrival (DOA) (or emitter locations); 3) strengths and cross correlations among the incident waveforms; 4) noise/interference strength. Examples and comparisons with methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum entropy (ME), as well as conventional beamforming are included. An example of its use as a multiple frequency estimator operating on time series is included.},

In this algorithm, the spatial smoothing MUSIC algorithm is used to establish the guidance vector relationship between the frequency domain and the spatial position of the targets, and GDE is used to estimate the number of sources.

An expanded PARAFAC model is proposed to make full use of the Vandermonde-like structure of the data model, which expands the received data through unitary transformation and links the problem of 2D angle estimation to the PARAFAC model. Unlike the traditional estimation algorithms such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and estimation method of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT), the proposed algorithm does not require spectral peak searching nor eigenvalue decomposition of the received signal covariance matrix. Furthermore, our algorithm can achieve automatic pairing of 2D angles, and it has blind and robust characteristic, therefore the proposed algorithm has higher working efficiency. In addition, the proposed algorithm can detect more targets and has better estimation accuracy than ESPRIT algorithm and PARAFAC method. Extensive numerical experiments verify the effectiveness and improvement of our algorithm.},

  abstract = {In this article, to get a high-resolution radar image with distributed frequency modulated continuous waveform multiple-input-multiple-output (FMCW MIMO) radar, Bayesian matching pursuit (BMP)-based imaging methods are proposed, in which the received signals at the distributed FMCW MIMO radars are reformulated in terms of the (azimuth, range) patches in the image region of interest and the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator that can estimate the azimuth angles and ranges of multiple targets is then derived. For a single FMCW MIMO radar, we first propose the BMP-based imaging, in which the support vector (indicating the presence of targets in the radar image patches) and the associated coefficients (the reflection coefficients of the associated targets) are iteratively updated. Because MAP estimation needs the combinatorial search over all possible candidates to find the nonzero elements in the support vector, an approximated MAP estimation method is newly proposed. In addition, by extending the BMP-based imaging for a single FMCW MIMO radar, we develop a new distributed BMP-based imaging method when multiple FMCW MIMO radars are spatially distributed. Through the simulation, we confirm that the proposed BMP-based radar imaging methods outperform the conventional backprojection method or the orthogonal matching pursuit-based method with slightly increased computational complexity.},

  abstract = {The direction of arrival (DOA) estimation problem as an essential problem in the radar system is important in radar applications. In this paper, considering a multiple-input and multiple-out (MIMO) radar system, the DOA estimation problem is investigated in the scenario with fast-moving targets. The system model is first formulated, and then by exploiting both the target sparsity in the spatial domain and the temporal correlation of the moving targets, a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based DOA estimation method combined with the Kalman filter (KF) is proposed. Moreover, the performances of traditional sparse-based methods are limited by the off-grid issue, and Taylor-expansion off-grid methods also have high computational complexity and limited performance. The proposed method breaks through the off-grid limit by transforming the problem in the spatial domain to that in the time domain using the movement feature. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in the DOA estimation problem for the fast-moving targets.},

Since the vehicle FMCW radar should recognize vehicles in the side/rear area when the driver initiates a lane change, the estimation of the joint TOA/DOA between the radar and targets is an important issue for solving complicated location tasks. However, conventional joint estimation methods such as 2D-ESPRIT and 2D-multiple signal classification (MUSIC) cannot be adopted for real-time implementation due to their high computational loads. To satisfy the required accuracy specifications and reduce complexity compared with the conventional estimator, we propose a low-complexity joint TOA and DOA estimator that uses the combined DFT-ESPRIT algorithm for FMCW radars. The performance of the proposed estimation in multitarget environments was derived and compared with the Monte Carlo simulation results. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed method was compared with that of 2D-ESPRIT with various parameters. To verify the performance of the proposed combination method, we implemented the FMCW radar and verified its performance in an anechoic chamber environment.},

The realized algorithm is highly flexible regarding the configuration of the imaging scene as well as the utilized antenna arrangement, because both can be altered during the operation of the device. As the implementation is carried out on a field programmable gate array with a fixed-point number representation, we state manageable design equations that can be used to configure the algorithm in order to achieve the desired performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio.},

A key shortcoming for present-day vehicular radar imaging is poor azimuth resolution (for side-looking operation) due to the form factor limits on antenna size and placement. In this paper, we propose a solution via a new multiple-input and multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) imaging technique, that applies coherent SAR principles to vehicular MIMO radar to improve the side-view (angular) resolution. The proposed 2-stage hierarchical MIMO-SAR processing workﬂow drastically reduces the computation load while preserving image resolution. To enable coherent processing over the synthetic aperture, we integrate a radar odometry algorithm that estimates the trajectory of ego-radar. The MIMO-SAR algorithm is validated by both simulations and real experiment data collected by a vehiclemounted radar platform.},

  abstract  = {Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction and computation of basis vectors. In many applications, especially in ﬂuid mechanics and image processing the matrices are dense, but low-rank matrices. In these cases, a truncated SVD corresponding to the most signiﬁcant singular values is suﬃcient. In this paper, we propose a tree based merge-and-truncate algorithm to obtain an approximate truncated SVD of the matrix. Unlike previous methods, our technique is not limited to “tall and skinny” or “short and fat” matrices and it can be used for matrices of arbitrary size. The matrix is partitioned into blocks and the truncated SVDs of blocks are merged to obtain the ﬁnal SVD. If the matrices are low rank, this algorithm gives signiﬁcant speedup over ﬁnding the truncated SVD, even when run on a single core. The error is typically less than 3\%.},
